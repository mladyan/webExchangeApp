# webExchangeApp
This web-based currency exchange application is built using React, Next.js, and MongoDB. It is designed for users who want a fast and simple way to convert currencies using real-time exchange rate data fetched from an external API. 
Every conversion is live - as users change input values or currency pairs, the latest rates are automatically retrieved without the need to refresh the page. Users can log in, with basic account data stored in a MongoDB database. 
To display currency portfolio, the application uses the Recharts library. This enables dynamic and clear visualizations. Additionally, the app utilizes Toast notifications to deliver real-time feedback to the user.
